# eSports (Counter-Strike) Classification
*location: `CSGO Classification.ipynb`*

# Introduction and Objective
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a popular title among the PC gaming community and this project will create a supervised machine learning model using `scikit-learn`'s `DecisionTreeClassifier` to predict map winners. In building our model, we will engineer new features and determine optimal hyperparameter settings. We will also use hypothesis testing to determine whether or not certain player demographics statistically rank higher than others. This project has potential implications for CS:GO betting websites in which players bet monetary virtual skins on upcoming matches in hopes of winning even more skins.
